Hello! I'm Niket Patel, a joint BA/MS student in Mathematics at UCLA through the Departmental Scholars Program, and I plan to pursue a PhD in Data Science at New York University in 2025. My research focuses on deep learning theory, diffusion models, and the mathematical foundations of artificial intelligence. When I'm not working on research, I enjoy hiking, solving complex math puzzles, and exploring new coffee shops around campus.
