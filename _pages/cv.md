  I am currently pursuing a joint undergraduate and master's degree in Mathematics at UCLA through the Departmental Scholars Program, with plans to join the PhD program at NYU this year. I'm passionate about developing the foundations of deep learning, with research interests spanning deep learning theory, diffusion models, and the broader intersection of mathematics and artificial intelligence.
